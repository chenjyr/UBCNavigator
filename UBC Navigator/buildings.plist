The historic Old Auditorium is one of the early building on campus (from the 1920&apos;s). Until recently, this 600-seat facility was used for large-ensemble concerts and opera productions. For many students, alumni and members of the community, the Old Auditorium occupies a special place. One of UBC&apos;s oldest buildings, the Auditorium is located at the heart of the University&apos;s arts precinct. It has, over the past 80-plus years, hosted countless dignitaries and festive occasions, been a training ground for generations of musicians and performers, and served as a valued social space for student activity and assembly. 

The UBC School of Music is delighted to announce the 20 million renovation of the historic 1925 Old Auditorium. After the completed renewal, The Old Auditorium will be the only 530-seat concert hall in Vancouver with a 60-seat orchestra pit, stunning collegial gothic architecture, a shoebox design for exceptional acoustics, excellent site lines and an intimate grandeur rarely found in North American concert halls. The Old Auditorium&apos;s new future will continue to serve its historic purpose as a dedicated performance centre, perfect for classical music and opera, and an outstanding facility for students, alumni, and the entire community, which will help ensure that the School of Music continues to lead the way in developing young performers of the highest calibre such as former graduates opera stars Ben Heppner and Judith Forst.

The Old Auditorium will continue to be the home of the Voice &amp; Opera Division, and will take its place on campus as a sister theatre to the world-class Chan Centre for the Performing Arts. The Chan Centre, with its 1,200-seat Chan Shun Concert Hall, will continue to provide students with a venue reflecting the larger sized North American theatres; the renovated 580-seat Auditorium will complement the Chan by offering the experience of a smaller sized European opera house.

- Food Services

The Beaty Biodiversity Museum is Vancouver&apos;s natural history museum, dedicated to creating a shared sense of community and wonder.

Fall in love with the diversity of life as you explore 20,000 square feet of exhibits, visit our teaching lab, and stare through the jaws of the largest creature ever to live on Earth—the blue whale.

The museum puts UBC&apos;s natural history collections, with more than two million specimens, on public view for the first time. Among our treasures are a 26-metre-long blue whale skeleton suspended in the Djavad Mowafaghian Atrium, the third-largest fish collection in the nation, and myriad fossils, shells, insects, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and plants from around British Columbia and the world.

Through a combination of exhibits, hands-on activities, educators&apos; resources, public presentations, and community and cultural engagement, we are working to increase understanding of the interconnectedness of all life on Earth. Just as important, we connect the world-renowned scientists at the adjacent Biodiversity Research Centre with the public. This unique combination of world-class, university-based research and beautiful, compelling exhibits makes the research conducted by UBC scientists more accessible and more relevant to the public.

The Beaty Biodiversity Museum works to illuminate how biodiversity evolved, how it is maintained, why it matters to humans, and how we can conserve it. The museum seeks to nurture the sense of wonder that many--especially youth--feel in experiencing biodiversity in hopes that they choose to preserve it as citizens, and perhaps even study it as scientists.

Science studies life&apos;s diversity in order to understand common principles underlying the biology of all species, to understand how our ecosystems came to be and how they function, and to learn how to act sustainably. Since the early 20th century, biologists at UBC have archived specimens of the many species they have studied in our natural history collections. These specimens, over two million to date, hold precious information about species and ecosystems of the past and present, and are guarded as time capsules sent to biologists centuries into the future. During these past decades our effort has grown, making UBC one of the world&apos;s leading universities in biodiversity research. But those decades have also seen biodiversity, and humanity&apos;s future, ever more imperilled.

The museum&apos;s world-class researchers, curators, and dedicated and creative outreach staff all work toward celebrating human responses to biodiversity, including art, culture, and our own love for biodiversity. At its core, the museum is designed to spread enthusiasm by revealing the amazing stories and beauty of biodiversity.

The UBC Fine Arts Gallery was founded in 1948 and located in the basement of Main Library on the University campus. For much of its early history, the Fine Arts Gallery was the only venue in the Vancouver region to focus exclusively on contemporary art. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Gallery achieved a national profile with exhibitions that explored what is now known as cultural studies, and by presenting innovative work by artists who would establish Vancouver as an international centre. The Gallery was used exclusively as exhibition space until 1994, when it began to house and administrate the University Art Collection.

On June 14, 1995, the Fine Arts Gallery was rededicated the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery and opened its new premises at 1825 Main Mall. The building, designed by Peter Cardew Architects, was made possible by the generous support of Dr. Helen E. Belkin and the Government of British Columbia through the World of Opportunity Campaign and the University of British Columbia.

Belkin Satellite

From 2001 to 2008 the Belkin Gallery ran an auxiliary space in downtown Vancouver which presented a mix of exhibitions by local artists, new projects by mid-career artists, experimental projects by UBC curatorial studies students, and served as an additional venue for the Belkin permanent collection. The Satellite&apos;s role as an outreach site provided a strong UBC Belkin presence in the downtown core and expanded our programs to a larger more diverse audience than the campus can offer. The Belkin continues to participate in the downtown community through satellite projects and collaborations with other galleries and organizations.

The Satellite space, located at 555 Hamilton Street, originated as the Bau-Xi Gallery in 1965, and is Vancouver&apos;s most enduring single gallery space. In August 2008, the Or Gallery took over the site.

The Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) is an interdisciplinary research centre governed by a Steering Committee of Deans from the Faculties of Medicine, Science, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Graduate Studies together with the VP Research. Currently, it gathers together in one open laboratory, nine UBC faculty members, variously affiliated with the Departments of Medicine, Medical Genetics, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cellular &amp; Physiological Sciences, Chemistry, Zoology, and Microbiology and Immunology, in the Faculties of Medicine and of Science. These investigators and their undergraduate and post-graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and technicians work closely together alongside each other in open laboratory space, sharing their knowledge and techniques.

BRC research focuses on the cellular and molecular basis of &quot;inflammation&quot;, the response of the body to infection or damage, and &quot;repair and regeneration&quot; that restore function to damaged tissues. The goal is to generate new knowledge about stem cells and how they generate the cells that are required for inflammation, repair and regeneration and the molecular details of how these processes are regulated. Dysregulated inflammation, repair and regeneration underlie important diseases like arthritis, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, infectious disease and cancer. The aim is to translate this new knowledge about into innovative treatments and vaccines.

Technology development Advances in biological knowledge are increasingly driven by technological developments that offer new opportunities for discovery. BRC researchers have established a tradition of adapting and extending many of the key technologies of modern biology. These have included advances in mass-spectrometry and proteomics, molecular genetics, the generation of recombinant monoclonal antibodies, and multi-parameter fluorescence activated cell sorting. The BRC is the home of the UBC Multi-user Flow Cytometry (FACS) Facility directed by Dr Fabio Rossi and the UBC Transgenic Facility directed by Dr Wilfred Jefferies and also serves as the focus of proteomics at UBC, housing the Collaborative Facility for Proteomics, directed by Dr Juergen Kast and the Global Proteomics Machine Data Base run by Dr Ron Beavis, Canada Research Chair in Experimental Bioinformatics.

Translation and commercialization The diversity of technological approaches in which BRC investigators have expertise, the interactive environment and the common research focus on a better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of inflammation, repair and regeneration, generates powerful synergies and has led to a series of discoveries that have proceeded to commercial development. A high proportion of BRC faculty have had experience with spin-off companies and their contacts and mentoring increases the likelihood that discoveries will be translated into practical benefits for the health of Canadians and their economy. BRC discoveries have led to the creation of many high-quality jobs for British Columbians.

In 1987, the University of British Columbia made a bold investment in the future by establishing Canada&apos;s first interdisciplinary biotechnology unit. Under the visionary leadership of Dr. Michael Smith, the UBC Biotechnology Laboratory was created and a gifted team of young scientists were recruited.  In 2004, the Biotechnology Laboratory was renamed the Michael Smith Laboratories in honour of the founding Director.

The Michael Smith Laboratories is governed internally by a Director (Dr. James Kronstad) that reports to the VP Academic, and who coordinates the inter-departmental activities of the MSL through an advisory committee of six Deans. There are approximately 250 research personnel in the Laboratory, with research activities falling into four major areas of emphasis:  

    Medical and animal molecular genetics
    Statistics, genomics and experimental evolution
    Bioengineering and bioanalytical/process technologies
    Plant and forestry molecular genetics

There is a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary interaction and overlap of interest among the different groups. Awards from prestigious national and international organizations are continually recognizing the faculty members for their excellence. In 1993, Dr. Michael Smith received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

General features

    One of Canada&apos;s most environmentally sound building projects.
    Designed by Matsuzaki Wright Architects of Vancouver.
    Total project cost $6 million.
    Offers 2,780 square metres (30,000 square feet) of resource and office space.
    Funding from a number of major donors from Canada and Asia including a generous donation from C.K. Choi and family, with matching funds from the Government of B.C.

Environmental innovations

    The building was constructed using materials that are recyclable or recycled, including bricks from demolished buildings and wooden beams from UBC&apos;s Old Armouries.
    Water is preheated using waste heat from an existing steam line.
    Cooling and air exchange is provided by 100 per cent natural ventilation. Atriums ventilate different parts of the building through a stack effect. High ceilings and windows that open also take advantage of natural ventilation.
    Offices are placed to optimize natural light, so the building requires less than one-third the artificial lighting typically used in an office building. Daylight sensors automatically dim indoor lighting.
    Its energy-efficient design reduces UBC&apos;s electricity use by 192,000 kilowatt-hours a year, the equivalent of the amount of energy used annually by 19 single family homes. This provides a savings to the university of $9,600 a year.
    Waterless, odourless composting toilets require no sewer connections and produce fertilizer for the garden.
    Recycled grey water from sinks and captured rain water is used for landscape watering, cutting water consumption in half.
    Landscape design by Cornelia Hahn Oberlander includes gingko trees, known for their ability to clean the air of pollutants.

Awards

    The 1996 Earth Award from the Building Operators and Managers&apos; Association of B.C.
    Progressive Architecture Award for Green Architecture, 1995
    Nominated for the 1996 Energy User News efficient building awards, a North American-wide competition

CIRS is a space for multidisciplinary education and research, and though it&apos;s one of the greenest buildings on earth, living within the resources and energy flow available on the site and surroundings, its goal is to become the baseline which future buildings will surpass.

Rather than simply reducing its environmental impact, CIRS enriches its environment by making use of resources that would otherwise go unused. CIRS sources energy from the ground and scavenges heat from neighbouring buildings, generates electricity from the sun, obtains ventilation from the wind and harvests its water from the rain. Utilizing new technologies, CIRS also returns energy and water back to its surroundings.

With its sustainable wood structure, large glass windows and living green walls and roof, the stunning four-story CIRS exterior blends harmoniously with the west coast beauty of the UBC campus.

It is a short walk from trails that meander down forested cliffs to the ocean and beaches. It sits on Sustainability Street, one of the first &quot;green&quot; corridors to intersect the campus between public spaces; just down the street from the CK Choi Building, one of the first green buildings in North America, and the Lui Centre for Global Issues, another innovative sustainable building.

CIRS represents technology and aesthetic aligning to demonstrate the impact of environmental advancement and design. Visitors and inhabitants of the 58,000 square foot building step through the main doors into the Science and Technology Commons,  a light and airy space full of activity and innovation, and connect immediately with the building&apos;s green features, like its vegetated wall with deciduous plantings changing with the seasons, its photo-voltaic cells, and its large solar collectors capturing energy for the hot water system.

The life pulse of the building is reflected upon entry through four large screens forming a video wall, displaying the building&apos;s real-time energy and water consumption and production, and information on CIRS&apos; partners as well as activities taking place in the building. The screens also display campus and regional sustainability indicators.

Research in the building is beginning to explore how people interact within the space, and with the building itself. Research is ongoing in the building to find urban sustainability solutions that work locally, and that can be replicated across the globe. The CIRS building is the starting point of a visionary experiment that will lead to massive strides in advancing sustainability.

The Clean Energy Research Centre&apos;s (CERC) multi-disciplinary approach is dedicated to developing knowledge and solutions that will reduce the environmental impact of the use of energy and ensuring sustainability of energy supply and use. 

CERC has existed in UBC&apos;s Faculty of Applied Science since 2000 but was officially opened in 2006 with the completion of a physical laboratory wing. Initially, CERC primarily involved researchers from the Departments of Chemical and Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, with some participation also from Materials Engineering and Electrical and Computing Engineering. However, CERC involvement has been expanded to include a boarder range of members representing all departments within Applied Science and other faculty departments active in energy research at UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan. Currently there are over 60 faculty members and 200 graduate students participating actively in CERC activities. We welcome collaboration with industry, academic institutions and governmental bodies, inside and outside Canada.

CERC provides state-of-the-art research facilities in a recently-completed building for the investigation of clean energy problems and the development of environmentally-friendly solutions.  Many of these facilities are unique. At the same time, CERC research affiliates are actively pursuing clean-energy-related projects in several other buildings on the UBC campus. CERC promotes excellent research by means of collaborative research projects, seminars, shared equipment, courses and other means.

Chemical and Biological Engineering (CHBE) is one of the six departments of UBC Engineering, Faculty of Applied Science (APSC).

Chemical Engineering was established at UBC in 1915, as the first Canadian chemical engineering program west of Ontario, and a separate Department of Chemical Engineering was established in 1954. The Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering was established in 1999, and reflects the growing need for engineers in the fields of biotechnology, biomedical and bio-resource engineering.

Biological Engineering evolved from Agricultural Engineering and Agricultural Mechanics established at UBC in 1945. In 1975, the name and degree were changed to Bio-Resource Engineering. In 1996, the Department of Chemical and Bio-Resource Engineering was formed from the merger of these two separate departments. In 1999, the name was changed to the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and a single undergraduate program is now offered with options in process, environmental and biological engineering.

The Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UBC has an established worldwide reputation for its accredited undergraduate programs, innovative research and the quality of its graduates and faculty. At present there are 27 full-time faculty in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, together with a support staff of 17. There are approximately 280 students in the final three years of the undergraduate programs, including the Co-op program. Graduates are awarded the degree of Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) and are eligible, after appropriate industrial experience, for registration as Professional Engineers.

In addition, roughly 175 students are studying in graduate programs. The Department offers programs leading to the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), Master of Science (M.Sc.), Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in a number of areas of specialization within chemical and biological engineering. The Department is actively engaged in applied research in chemical and biological engineering, supported in part by external funding of about $2.7 million a year.

The Department of Chemistry at UBC, located in Vancouver, has facilities to accommodate over 300 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty. As one of North America&apos;s leading research units, the Department has built an international reputation for excellence on the strength of its faculty, teaching and cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences.
The Buildings

The main Chemistry building was the original Science building for UBC (constructed in 1922) and has since undergone extensive renovations to meet the updated needs of chemical research and instruction. Three additional wings were added between 1959 and 1965. A joint Chemistry/Physics building, opened in 1989, provides 55,000 square feet of additional research and office space, enhancing interdisciplinary research opportunities and giving the UBC Chemistry Department one of the most comfortable and up-to-date research spaces in North America. The Advanced Materials and Process Engineering Laboratory (AMPEL) opened in the fall of 1995, provides a unique interdisciplinary approach to research in materials science.
Shops &amp; Services

Fully equipped to meet the needs of its research groups, the Chemistry Department maintains electronic, mechanical and glass-blowing shops, NMR, X-ray crystallography and mass spectroscopic facilities, as well as a departmental illustrator, microanalyst and biological services laboratory. The workshops are an important adjunct to the Department, with the capability to fabricate and repair specialized equipment. As well as maintaining the over 4,000 pieces of electronic equipment in the Department, the technical support personnel are involved in the design and development of new equipment. For instance, ESR, NMR, and mass spectrometers as well as NMR probes have all been produced in the shops. There are 15 technicians in the electronic and mechanical shops, and a full-time glass-blower. The departmental library conveniently maintains its own collection of journals, and the main science and medical libraries are nearby.

The Earthquake Engineering Research Facility (EERF) has been in operation since the fall of 2003. It brings together under one roof an impressive array of test equipment for specialized research on earthquakes and their effects on structures and the soil that supports them.

The 10 m high overhead area of the EERF enables the testing of large scale structural models. Three different earthquake simulators (or shake tables) are housed in the facility.  The centre-piece of the facility is the six-degrees-of-freedom shake table, with a footprint of about 4 m by 4 m and the capacity to shake 30-tonnes structures. The six degrees of freedom allow researchers to mimic more realistically the shaking produced by actual earthquakes. The second shake table has a footprint of about 6 m by 6 m, has a payload capacity of about 100 tonnes, and is used for the uni-axial testing of large-size structures. To put this in perspective, a small, two-storey house weighs approximately 50 tonnes. This shake table is also used for geotechnical studies of large scale foundation models to investigate important problems in seismic design, such as the interaction between a structure and its supporting soil and soil liquefaction effects on structures. The EERF also has a third, portable uni-axial shake table for testing small structures and building components.

In addition to housing world-class equipment, the EERF is designed with state-of-the-art Internet, multimedia and video-conferencing technology.  A unique aspect of the EERF is its capability for long-distance connectivity with other research centres in Canada and abroad. This technology allows researchers from other universities access to a ‘virtual laboratory,&apos; where they can actively interact with EERF researchers during the various phases of a research project. As well, the strengths of our research team, combined with the beautiful setting of Vancouver, makes this facility very attractive to visiting researchers, particularly from the Pacific Rim, where about 90% of the world&apos;s earthquakes occur.

For more information, please contact Prof. Carlos Ventura, Director of EERF or Mr. Felix Yao, Manager, Earthquake &amp; Structural Labs.

If you have an inquisitive mind, enjoy biology, and want to unravel the mysteries of nature, then the Bachelor of Science in Forestry (B.Sc.), Forest Sciences program may be for you.

Students study the scientific principles related to the growth and development of forest organisms, and the ecology of plant and animal communities. Students select an area of concentration during their second year and specialize their studies according to their own interests, including genetics, ecology, entomology, pathology, silviculture, and fire science. An International Specialization is also possible, focusing on forest ecosystems in another part of the world. This program provides a partial basis for acquiring professional certification (Registered Professional Foresters or Registered Professional Biologists).

We take advantage of numerous values that forests provide for us, such as wood fibre, drinking water, hunting, and fishing. Our use of one part of the forest ecosystem can impact all of the other parts. How do the plants and animals in forest ecosystems react to insects and disease, climate change, pollution, harvesting, and recreational use? How do we sustain the biological diversity of our forests while meeting our resource needs? To answer questions like these, we depend on the research conducted by forest scientists.

Forests are complex ecosystems, comprised of thousands of organisms, both plants and animals, but also insects, fungi, algae, and bacteria. The way we manage our natural resources is based upon our understanding of how these organisms live and interact with each other. It is also based on our understanding of the non-living components of the forest environment, such as geology, soil, water (hydrology), fire, and climatology. The vast number of different factors that affect the growth and health of forest ecosystems make the field of forest science exciting and diverse, as it encompasses multiple scientific disciplines.

Research is ongoing in all aspects of forestry and forest conservation to better understand individual aspects of our forests such as wildlife, fire, insects, disease, soil, tree genetics, and forest regeneration. Each of these components is studied in isolation, but this focus is expanded to see how they interact with each other as part of the larger forest ecosystem. The forest science degree program offers a unique opportunity to specialise your studies while applying what you learn to the &quot;bigger picture&quot; of the forest ecosystem and forest resources management.

The Friedman Building Renovation Project is a four story, 6229 m2 facility that houses the School of Audiology and Speech Sciences and the Physical Therapy Division, School of Rehabilitation Sciences. Completed in 2008 the Friedman building is upgraded to improve life safety, accessibility, energy efficiency, and opportunities for student/faculty interaction. All of these measures will greatly enhance the learning and working conditions in the building. The project is LEED Gold certified through the Canada Green Building Council.

Recollective guided the sustainability process as well as conducted a study to evaluate the energy savings and the potential to achieve LEED Gold.  We carried out a Life Cycle Analysis to estimate the avoided environmental impacts of retaining existing elements of the building and managed the LEED certification process.

Demonstrating high water efficiency, Friedman uses no water for irrigation and reduces the amount of potable water used for faucets and toilets by 40%

Overall the building saves approximately 284 GJ of energy and reduces 73.4 tons of CO2 per year compared to the reference case. To further offset CO2, UBC Renew purchased Green Power Certificates equivalent to 100% of the building&apos;s electrical consumption.

Friedman made extensive use of low VOC products including adhesives, sealants, paints &amp; carpets. Urea-formaldehyde free millwork was also used throughout the building.

Located at the UBC Point Grey Campus on the University Westbrook Mall and close to University Boulevard, Friedman provides excellent access to public transportation and bike areas as well as shower facilities for cyclists.

The origins of the UBC Department of Geography go back to the establishment of the Department of Geology and Mineralogy in 1915. A half-year course in Physical Geography which was given in the fall of 1915, has become, in the form of the year-long Geography 101, the oldest continuing geography course in any Canadian university

In 1922-23 the name of the Department was changed to Geology and Geography, and UBC became the first Canadian university to have Geography as an academic division. The faculty consisted of three full-time members.

When the University of British Columbia moved to its present Point Grey site in the Fall of 1925 the Department of Geology and Geography was placed in a &quot;temporary&quot; building. That building is the present Geography Building, completely rebuilt inside during the late 1970s, and still standing after more than 60 years as a &quot;temporary&quot; building.

In the Fall of 1946, J. Lewis Robinson was appointed to organize and expand the Geography program at UBC. Robinson was the first Ph.D. in Geography to be appointed at UBC. He was joined by John Chapman, from Oxford University, in 1947, and J. Ross Mackay, from McGill University, in 1949. In the 1947-48 session the department offered 12 Geography courses with a total enrollment of 750 students. A graduate program was started in 1947 and the first Honours students in Geography graduated in 1948.

In 1959, Robinson became the first Head of the newly defined Department of Geography. In the next decade undergraduate enrollments in Geography courses became the largest in any Canadian university, graduate students in residence increased from 14 in 1960 to 33 in 1965. A Ph.D. program in Geography was introduced in 1962. In 1972, a B.Sc. program in physical geography was introduced. In 1975, a M.Sc. program followed and in 1988, the Atmospheric Science program (sponsored cooperatively by Oceanography and Geography) was initiated.

The faculty increased steadily during the 1970s, to a total of 23; by the end of the decade there were 81 undergraduate and 28 graduate courses in Geography, 50 graduating B.A. Majors and 10 graduating B.Sc. Majors and Honours students, over 50 graduate students in residence, and a total student enrollment of over 2,000.

During the 1980s the number of student enrollees exceeded 3,000 and the number of permanent, full-time faculty increased to 25.5. The new faculty in part were appointed as a result of the Department&apos;s success in being awarded two new programs from the Provincial Funds for Excellence in Education, in Atmospheric Science and the Geography of Japan.

Today the Department enrolls between 4000 and 4500 course enrollees and supervises about 80 graduate students. An external review of the Department in 2000 judged it the top all-round Geography Department in Canada, and comparable to the top 5 programs in the United States and Great Britain.

Hampton Place was established before UBC&apos;s Official Community Plan, but remains a vital part of UTown@UBC with the distinction of being the first UBC Vancouver neighbourhood.

Timeline

Hampton Place was officially opened in 1989.

Background

Hampton Place was the first major family housing neighbourhood constructed at UBC Vancouver, pre-dating UBC&apos;s Land Use Plan (formerly called the Official Community Plan, or OCP). It was the first major project of the UBC Properties Trust and generated $80 million of endowment principal. All proceeds were endowed for core academic use. Among the largest beneficiaries were the Faculty of Science ($5 million), Faculty of Arts ($6 million), Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies ($10 million), Social Science and Humanities Fund ($15 million) and Graduate Student fellowship matching ($10 million).

Features

Here are some of the prominent features of the Hampton Place neighbourhood:

    - 957 residential units located in 11 buildings
    - Approximately 2,000 residents
    - Original residents were retirees and older adults, but today, there are many families with children

Housing

A total of 957 new residential units were constructed for this neighbourhood, all of which was designated for family housing.

Date:
Phase I (north wing) 2005; Phase II (centre block and south wing) 2008. 

Architect:
Downs Archambault &amp;Partners, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates

Cost:
$68 million

Sources of funds:
Irving K. Barber, BC Government, UBC.

Architectural features:
Occupies former site of Main Library.
The north wing houses the state-of-the-art Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) that expands the Library&apos;s capacity to house print materials. The ASRS consists of four aisles, each measuring 100 feet long, 65 feet high and 45 feet wide. Floor-to-ceiling shelves store 19,000 stainless steel bins, which contain about 800,000 bar-coded volumes and other materials. In each aisle, automated mini-load cranes slide back and forth on tracks. The ASRS is linked to the Library&apos;s online catalogue. After Library staff or users request an item, the robotic cranes identify and retrieve the correct steel bin, matching the location of the bin to the requested bar code. The automated cranes deliver bins to a sorting station where staff retrieve and relay requested items to the circulation desk. The entire process takes about two minutes. The north wing also features a fireproof vault for rare and special collections and the Ridington Room, a new double-floor reading area with original, commissioned glass artwork.
Centre block consists of the original 1925 Library building with substantial earthquake and fire safety upgrades, and features the Chapman Learning Commons (former main concourse). The south wing includes classroom and office space, with state-of-the-art multimedia and communications services.

- Psychology

The UBC Department of Psychology is housed in the Kenny Building, which stands near the corner of University Boulevard and West Mall, near the Campus&apos;s western boundary with the Pacific. The main feature of the Kenny Building is its large core atrium, which promotes interaction among faculty members and students. The front entrance is graced by an original totem pole carved by the renowned West Coast carver, Art Thompson.

The Kenny Building was completed in 1984 and was named after Douglas T. Kenny, whose long career included service as Head of the Department of Psychology, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and President of UBC.
	
Psychology is both a science and a profession. On the scientific side, researchers try to measure, explain, and modify the behaviour of humans and other species. Research in Psychology includes both behavioural and physiological studies of many sorts. As a profession, Psychology includes a number of different types of practitioners who apply psychological principles to solve practical problems. This group includes clinical specialists, who work in the areas of mental health, behavioural medicine, stress management, psychological testing, and guidance counselling.

		<string>
Design: Architectura in collaboration with Arthur Erickson
Official opening: March 10, 1997
Area: 17,200 square metres
Capacity of stacks: 800,000 volumes
Study space: 920 individual carrels, plus rooms for group study
Cost: $24 million dollars

In 1991, the area immediately to the west of the underground Sedgewick Undergraduate Library was confirmed as the site for Walter C. Koerner Library.

Construction began in January 1995. Sedgewick/Koerner continued to operate, maintaining most library services. The two underground floors of Sedgewick were renovated and upgraded to current library and safety standards. These two levels were extended on the west to become the base of the new construction between Old Administration, Mathematics, and the Math Annex.

The Walter C. Koerner Library opened officially on March 10, 1997. The new construction extends five stories above the level of the mall. The new design, while classical in order and structure, is modern in material and technology, with a central entry on axis with the Main Library and a tripartite vertical organization into base, body, and attic.

The base is composed of a battered granite wall, complementing the materials of the Main Library. The granite is from the same quarry as the granite used on the Main Library. There is a course of clerestory windows and a continuous planter above.

On the front façade, the three mid levels are sheathed in a flush plane of glass shielded by a system of external glass screens. The transparency of these levels allows the building to &apos;read&apos; as a library and permits the maximum amount of appropriately screened daylight into the building.

Level seven, the classical attic, is set back from the levels below. This level is finished in a sloping natural zinc roof. Zinc is a soft grey material that weathers and ages well. This is also the major material of the side elevations.

The back façade is clad in stucco with a grid of diamond-shaped windows. The central nave is top-lit by a shallow vault of translucent glass.

Walter C. Koerner Library totals 17,200 square metres: 7,000 square metres of new construction and 10,200 square metres of renovated space from Sedgewick Library.

Functions within the building are composed of 54% for collections (6,420 shelving units for an approximate total of 800,000 volumes), 25% for service and offices, and 21% for 920 study spaces.

Funding was through donations to UBC&apos;s World of Opportunity Campaign, with matching funds from the provincial government and the President&apos;s discretionary funds. It is named in honour of Walter C. Koerner, recognizing his lifetime commitment to and support of the University and the Library and his substantial gift toward the construction of Koerner Library.

The UBC Landscape Architecture is presently located in the middle of the Point Grey Campus. The Landscape Architecture Annex at 2371 Main Mall houses the Landscape Architecture Studio. The neighboring Macmillan Building at 2357 Main Mall is home to the Landscape Architecture Program office, faculty offices and the LARC Computer Lab.

Landscape Architecture and Environmental Design Program Office

Located in Room 379 on the third floor of the Macmillan Building the Program Office provides a front-line location for enquiries and making contact with the Programs. Here you will find staff member, Dorothy Tran who coordinates the daily life of the Program&apos;s admissions and student records. The Faculty member offices are located just down the hall.

The Landscape Architecture Studio

Students in the MLA program are assigned a studio work-space through our annual &quot;desk lottery&quot; at the beginning of each academic year. Students from all three year levels within the program work side by side, encouraging a culture of peer learning and support. The upper two levels of the building are designated student work spaces. Studio provisions include drawing and layout tables, and a secure, twenty-four-hour-accessible environment with wireless and internet connections. The collective, collegial atmosphere of the School&apos;s design studios requires that students treat their own workspaces and allied common areas with appropriate, professional respect. The lower levels of the building include a common area for student leisure and discussions and the adjacent &quot;Jury Room&quot; for presentations and reviews.

Winter Session (Building 5)

Building 5 studio units are furnished with a full-size bed, desk, chair, dresser, dining table and chairs, stove and under-counter fridge. The two-, three- and four-bedroom shared units have twin XL beds, a furnished living area, full-size fridge and dishwasher. There are washrooms in all units. Winter-session residents are required to participate in the residence lottery and must move out at the end of winter session.
Year Round (Building 1, 2, 4 and 6)

Buildings 1, 2, 4 and 6 are well-suited to upper-year and graduate students who are looking for a year-round, independent lifestyle. Some floors are reserved for graduate students.

Living in Marine Drive buildings 1, 2, 4 and 6 is based on a year-round contract, so it&apos;s exempt from the residence lottery.

Shared Units:

Two-, three- and four-bedroom shared units also have a furnished living area, full-size fridge and a dishwasher. Washrooms are in all units.

The School of Music at The University of British Columbia is the largest school of its kind in western Canada. The study of music was introduced at UBC as early as 1935, with noon-hour lectures and recorded recitals. The first formal courses, offered through the Department of Extension, were introduced during the war years.

In 1947, the noted Canadian violinist Harry Adaskin was appointed Head of a new Department of Music. Expansion followed under his leadership with the appointments of composers Jean Coulthard and Barbara Pentland. Then in 1958, Welton Marquis was appointed Head with the mandate of initiating a range of music degree programs. The first class of Bachelor of Music students entered the Department in September, 1959.

Talented and committed administrators cultivated enormous growth in ensuing years. Three noted scholars, Donald McCorkle, Wallace Berry and William Benjamin, followed by the renowned pianist Robert Silverman, bassoonist Jesse Read and current Director theory scholar Dr. Richard Kurth, have seen their efforts result in a considerable increase in numbers of faculty, students, course offerings and levels of activity. Particularly notable is the recent expansion in graduate programs, rounding out a program of high standard and broad scope. Recognition of the increased scope was given in 1986 when the Department of Music became the School of Music.

Today, with a faculty of distinguished composers, scholars and performers, the School of Music produces graduates who work in all aspect of the music from high profile artists and composers such as opera stars Ben Heppner and Judith Forst and internationally acclaimed composers such as Paul Steenhuisen to members of orchestras and chamber ensembles around the world. Non performance graduates less in the public eye but as important are the hundreds of graduates who write, research and teach, at universities, public schools and privately as well as graduates working behind the scenes in concert production, broadcasting, arts management and the recording and film industries.

Welcome to Nitobe Memorial Garden, a traditional Japanese Tea and Stroll garden located at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Nitobe Garden is considered to be the one of the most authentic Japanese gardens in North America and among the top five Japanese gardens outside of Japan, the Nitobe Garden includes a rare authentic Tea Garden with a ceremonial Tea House.

&quot;I am in Japan,&quot; was the reaction of the Crown Prince (now Emperor) of Japan as he walked through UBC&apos;s renowned Nitobe Memorial Garden. The exquisite work of art was created out of two-and-a-half acres (one hectare) of pristine forest by landscape architects and gardeners recommended by the government of Japan.

The garden honours Inazo Nitobe (1862-1933) whose goal was &quot;to become a bridge across the Pacific.&quot; Among many other memorials to him is his portrait on the 5000 yen note.

Each tree, stone and shrub has been deliberately placed and is carefully maintained to reflect an idealized conception and symbolic representation of nature. There is harmony among natural forms - waterfalls, rivers, forests, islands and seas - and a balance of masculine and feminine forces traditionally attributed to natural elements. Realizing that many native trees and shrubs could be trained and pruned in typical Japanese fashion, the garden&apos;s creators incorporated them as unique features. Some maple and cherry trees and most of the azaleas and iris were brought from Japan. A place of reflection, where each step reveals a new harmony, the garden is designed to suggest a span of time - a day, a week or a lifetime - with a beginning, choice of paths, and ending.

Although it is appreciated by all who visit, it is highly recommended Nitobe visitors take advantage of tours. Visit in spring for the cherry blossoms, summer for the irises or autumn for the maples. The subtleties of Nitobe Memorial Garden can be enjoyed throughout the year: a reflecting pond with Koi, streams and waterfalls, stone lanterns and the teahouse — all contribute to a unique and meaningful experience.

Since its founding two decades ago, the mission of the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies has been to create collaborative, interdisciplinary, basic research programs for scholars at all stages of their career. It is one of only 24 similar institutions worldwide, based on the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and devoted to the free pursuit of learning and research at the highest levels. The Institute&apos;s achievements include the creation of a significant community of scholars – more than 350 Faculty Associates in total – at the University of British Columbia and an even wider global community of individuals and partner institutions.

In March 1999, the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies moved to its new, permanent facilities in the Leon &amp;Thea Koerner University Centre, formerly the UBC Faculty Club. Completed in 1959 by Frederic Lasserre and Koyander &amp;Wright Associated Architects, the building was closed in 1994, then reopened and renovated with the financial support of the Institute. The Institute occupies the top floor and the residential east wing, which in 2008 the University renamed as the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. A new, imposing glass atrium that connects the main building and the east wing of administrative offices and guest rooms echoes the Erickson &amp;Massey Associates&apos; later modernist additions to the University Centre and publicly identifies the Institute. The dedicated residential scholars&apos; area includes private research offices and the office of the Institute Director. The Institute&apos;s conference facilities are available to the UBC community for research-related events.

The Institute&apos;s facilities and programs are intended to represent connecting points for unconstrained thinking in all fields of research.

The University of British Columbia situated on the edge of Point Grey, Vancouver is well known for its multitude of plants with its renowned Nitobe Gardens and UBC Gardens. Many lesser known gardens are also scattered throughout the Campus, one of the most stunning being the UBC Rose Garden on the Northern edge of the campus. Its elevated viewing area overlooks the majestic snow-capped mountains and the ocean as well as offering beautiful blooms to admire through the rose season typically occurring June to September. A romantic spot (including many weddings in the summer months), the Rose Garden is visited throughout the year.

	<key>Roy Barnett Recital Hall</key>
	<dict>
		<key>address</key>
		<string>6361 Memorial Road (B3)</string>
		<key>info</key>
		<string>
Twenty years after he retired, Roy Barnett (BCom &apos;61) was determined to play the piano. At 72, he enrolled at the Victoria Conservatory of Music. Four years later, Barnett plays a range of classical music which includes some Beethoven sonatas, Bach preludes and fugues, and Chopin etudes.

&quot;I&apos;m hoping to develop my playing to a high level and am having a lot of fun in the process,&quot; says Barnett, former treasurer of what was then Novopharm, one of Canada&apos;s largest generic pharmaceutical companies.

&quot;I have always admired performances by classical pianists,&quot; recalls Barnett. &quot;I played and performed classical music on the accordion until my late teens, but knew all along that it was a much less versatile instrument than the piano. In the 1980s, I bought a piano but didn&apos;t have enough time to devote to practicing seriously on it. Time passed, and finally it was my wife, Gunilla, who urged me most persuasively, to start taking lessons. The decision to do so was one of the high points in my life.&quot;

A lifelong interest in music led Roy, with the full support of his wife, Gunilla, to make a gift of $2 million dollars to the UBC School of Music, part of which has now been used to renovate the Recital Hall.

This performance and rehearsal facility was renamed the Roy Barnett Recital Hall in his honour and reopened with a ceremony and concert on September 15, 2010.

&quot;I felt that the opportunity to fund the renewal of the Recital Hall was an exciting and very effective way to give back to the community,&quot; says Barnett of enhancing the facilities for the education and professional development of music students.

&quot;It appealed to me instantly, especially since my funding of this truly worthwhile project would enable me to participate, to some extent, in certain decisions to be made during the renovation. This involvement would be most satisfying.&quot;

The 255-seat concert hall and rehearsal space is occupied nearly every day of the week with student recitals, ensemble programs and performances by faculty, alumni and guest artists.

&quot;Hundreds of events take place in the Recital Hall every year,&quot; says Professor Richard Kurth, Director of the School of Music. &quot;It has been the core of the music building since it opened in 1968 and the renewed space will allow both undergraduate and graduate students to develop as solo and chamber music performers.&quot;

Enhanced acoustics, new audiovisual equipment, updated aesthetics, and increased accessibility make the Roy Barnett Recital Hall an essential space for budding musicians. The enlarged and reconfigured stage will improve the acoustics of students&apos; performances and allow audience members to benefit from a more intimate experience with the musicians.

&quot;It&apos;s exciting to think that I will actually see and hear the results and benefits that have been realized from this particular renovation,&quot; Barnett says.

From classical to contemporary genres, the Roy Barnett Recital Hall will allow students to develop like never before. The new state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment will encourage the development of electro-acoustic music, the combination of electronic technology with live performance. Updated recording facilities will also enable students and faculty to review and archive their performances based on the latest recording standards.

&quot;It&apos;s essential to hear yourself playing,&quot; says Chris Hutchinson, a 4th year flute major who has performed annual recitals in the hall since 2006. &quot;To be able to hear yourself under the pressures of performance as well as how others hear you is very beneficial for developing one&apos;s career.&quot;

As he embarks on his final year at UBC, Hutchinson recognizes the increasing importance of recording live performances, especially on high definition video.

&quot;Many universities require you to submit a DVD when applying to graduate programs. They&apos;re looking for the whole package: stage presence, sound, technique, command of the stage. These professional resources will give UBC students a competitive edge.&quot;

&quot;This generous gift represents the power of individual philanthropy,&quot; says Kurth. &quot;Roy&apos;s relationship as a proud alumnus and music lover quintessentially represents the School of Music&apos;s efforts to support a culture of music in the community. He understands the
importance of music in everyday life.&quot;

When asked about his vision for the hall, Barnett says, &quot;It&apos;s a facility to be proud of and should be kept in top condition. These renovations will help the hall become more effective in the development of students in the School of Music and provide memorable experiences for all who use it.&quot;

The Barnett Hall is located in the School of Music Building (6361 Memorial Road).

- Linguistics

Linguistics is the scientific study of human language. Linguists are interested in questions such as the following:

- What are the structural properties of languages, at the level of sounds, words, sentences, and meaning?
- To what extent are the languages of the world similar or different?
- How is language acquired, by children and in adulthood?
- How is it processed in the mind/brain?
- How do people produce and perceive speech?
- How do languages change over time?

Linguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field which combines research methods from the humanities and the social, natural, and mathematical sciences.

The current Student Union Building (or SUB) opened on September 26, 1968 on the site of the old University stadium.

It is the second SUB on the UBC campus. The first was Brock Hall, which opened in 1940, but had become inadequate to serve the growing student population by the late 1950s.

Starting in 1958, there was talk of building a new SUB, but nothing serious happened until the 1960s when an architectural consultant was hired and a design competition was held. The winner of the competition was Kenneth R. Snider, and plans were put in place to construct a new building based on his design.

To pay for the new building, the students approved a $15 increase in their AMS fee through a referendum, and altogether paid about $3.5 million of the $5 million cost.

When it opened in 1968, the new SUB contained business offices for the AMS, a bank, a barbershop, a games room, a cafeteria, an auditorium, meeting rooms, club rooms, and a bowling alley (the bowling alley remained until the mid-1980s).

The SUB at that time did not contain a pub, but a campaign in favour of a student drinking establishment on campus soon led to the opening of The Pit, which was first located on the second floor. Only in 1973, after an expansion of the SUB, did The Pit move into its current basement location.

Date:
Original Construction: 1968
Additions: 1981, 1984

Architect:

1984: $1.2 million

Sources of funds:
1968: 78% financed by a $15 per year levy paid by all students

Architectural features:
This buildings with brick cladding and stucco. This building is considered as the product of the confrontational nature of the sixties with the usage of heavily treated, massive concrete walls. 

Construction Type:
Concrete 

Building users:
Alma Mater Society, Bank of Montreal, Plant Operations, School of Human Kinetics, Athletics and Sports Services, UBC Food Services 

Notes:
The Old Stadium was demolished to make way for the construction of the Student Union Building when Brock Hall became too small to house all student activities. The building consists of a ballroom, small conference rooms, seminar rooms and club areas; special facilities include recreation area (pub, lounge), cultural area (art gallery auditorium), and commercial areas (coffee shop, food courts); also meeting rooms and general open space. Also contains a large food service facility. It is designed to be highly utilized by the undergraduate students. It is also extensively used for conferences and entertainment activities. A pub called &quot;The Pit&quot; is located in its basement.

The UBC Film Production Program began in 1969 with a handful of film workshops offered to Department of Theatre students. From these workshops grew today&apos;s renowned program, which has more than 350 alumni, many of whom are leaders in Canada&apos;s film and television industries. Alumni have screened their work at film festivals around the world including Cannes, Berlinale, SXSW, Sundance, Toronto, IDFA and Hot Docs.

In 2006, under the leadership of a group of recent graduates, the UBC Film Production Alumni Association (FPAA) was formed and has been working to create events, mentorship opportunities and strong alumni involvement.

Achievements of the program since 2006 include:

- A renovated and spacious new building to house the program
- Revised BFA, Diploma and MFA curricula
- Expansion of the BFA/Diploma Program from two years to three years
- A new faculty position specializing in the area of fiction directing
- Professional mentorship program through the UBC Film Production Alumni Association
- An educational partnership with Emily Carr University
- Student access to professional internships and additional equipment and services from the Vancouver film and television industry

The program now serves more than 70 students annually.

The Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre (formerly UBC Winter Sports Centre, also known as UBC Thunderbird Arena) is a LEED Silver certified indoor arena in Canada, on the campus of the University of British Columbia. Located in the University Endowment Lands, it is just outside the city limits of Vancouver, British Columbia. The arena is home to the UBC Thunderbirds men&apos;s and women&apos;s ice hockey teams, and contains one international-size 61 m × 30 m (200 ft × 98.4 ft) ice rink.

The facility was built around an older hockey facility, the historic Father Bauer Arena, which opened in October 1963. This was named after the late Rev. Father David Bauer, who, together with Bob Hindmarch, established Canada&apos;s first national hockey team at UBC in 1963 in preparation for the 1964 Winter Olympics. The UBC Thunderbird Arena replaced the Father Bauer Arena as the home of the UBC Thunderbirds ice hockey team.

The main ice rink has 5,033 permanent seats, another 1,800 temporary seats will be installed for the games and for events like concerts the capacity can be extended up to 7,500 people. The other rinks are Father Bauer Arena and Rink C with spectator capacities of 980 and 200, respectively.

Construction began in April 2006 with the refurbishment of the Father Bauer Arena and the addition of a new practice arena. The new stadium arena was opened on July 7, 2008.

The University Neighbourhoods Association (UNA) approximates a municipal council for the local areas on campus, promoting the creation of a vibrant, sociable, safe and diverse university town community at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

The UNA Board of Directors is comprised of four directors elected by residents, two directors appointed by UBC and one appointed by the Alma Mater Society (AMS).  The number of elected directors is determined by neighbourhood population and will thus increase over time.

The UNA is responsible for local regulation (such as noise, parking, and animal control), as well as community programs and recreation, elections, landscaping, policies and by-laws, and acts as a liaison for the community&apos;s use of UBC facilities. Residents&apos; concerns, opinions and views are heard through the UNA and it will help shape future development and the allocation of community facilities at UBC.

Vancouver School of Theology has been part of theological education in British Columbia for over 100 years — a rich, pioneering tradition upon which to build. We are a direct descendent of a number of denominational institutions founded in Vancouver over the years.

The Anglican Church&apos;s college, Anglican Theological College (ATC) moved into the Chancellor Building on the University of British Columbia campus in Point Grey, Vancouver in 1927. This building, which in recent years provided student residences and a home for the H.R. MacMillan Theological Library, was demolished in 2007 as part of VST&apos;s land development and Iona Building renovation.

Also in 1927, Ryerson College, Westminster Hall, and the Congregational College of British Columbia were amalgamated to form the United Church‘s Union College of British Columbia, housed in the west wing of the Iona Building, constructed that year. In the 1930s, the tower section was added.

Throughout the 1960s, Union College and ATC held joint classes in several disciplines and began exploring the idea of a new ecumenical theological centre serving the Pacific Northwest.

Out of this exploration, Vancouver School of Theology was formed in 1971.

The 1970s and early &apos;80s were exciting years of growth, with students coming from many denominations. With the affiliation of St. Andrew&apos;s Hall, the Presbyterian Church in Canada officially became associated with VST.

The School established its partnership with First Nations more than 25 years ago, and offers the innovative Native Ministries Degree Program by extension, reaching out to distant parts of Canada and the western U.S.A. From the mid-1990s through 2008 VST offered the Canadian Studies Certificate Program co-sponsored with Shizuoka Eiwa College in Japan.

Today, the School is developing new courses and programs that explore a re-imagined Christianity that actively engages the world. As well, VST has established Iona Pacific: Inter-Religious Centre. Iona Pacific creates a platform from which VST can engage multiple voices and faiths, and sits alongside the core work of the School.

The Wayne and William White Engineering Design Centre  serves UBC engineering students and enhances the learning, social and physical environment of the Applied Science community.

Notable features of the building include:

- Engineering Design Studio. Design studio space to enhance delivery of engineering design courses, students&apos; engineering design activities and collaborations across all engineering disciplines.
    
- Project and Design Teaching. Instructional spaces for project and design teaching, including a project room and a study room.

- Student Workshop and Team Competition Space. One of the Faculty&apos;s priorities is to support design through student-directed teams, competitions and related extra-curricular activities. The student-administered workshop and its facilities will support student-directed teams, competitions and related extracurricular activities.

The EDC&apos;s primary role is to provide a new space for interaction, integration and innovation in engineering education. It is a place that will bring students and staff together from the various engineering faculties for a common experience.

The ground floor comprises the most active spaces that demand the greatest integration – the heart and soul of the building. A Design Studio provides space for new curriculum focused on project-centered integrated group design. The Competition Space is primarily controlled by students and houses team projects completed for national and international design competitions – previously  scattered around the campus and hidden from the view of other students and the public. The Competition Space will provide further opportunity for students on teams to learn from and with each other as well as a highly visible showcase for the impressive results of the teams work. The atrium  provides a student commons for socializing and multifunctional space. The entire ground floor is visually interconnected with transparency and may be opened up for exhibitions and open houses and other special events.

The second floor comprises a Project Teaching Area with a multipurpose classroom connected to an exterior deck at the west. At the east is a Reading Room with an entry promenade over the main building entry to increase acoustic separation and provide interest. In the middle is an office suite housing the building&apos;s administration and offices for the Engineering Design Chairs and Instructors. All of these areas have direct access to the open atrium.

A third floor was included in construction with an eye to expansion to meet future needs.

UBC&apos;s latest family housing initiative stretches across 110 acres of South Campus. When completed, Wesbrook Place will be the largest neighbourhood on UBC&apos;s Vancouver campus. Over 12,500 students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni and members of the general public will live here in a mix of townhouses and apartments.

Background

The South Campus neighbourhood, also referred to as Wesbrook Place, will be the largest neighbourhood in UTown@UBC. When complete, Wesbrook Place will be a showcase for sustainable development practices. All construction adheres to UBC&apos;s Residential Environmental Assessment Program.

Sustainable strategies have been adopted for land use, stormwater distribution, rain water retention, green roofs, rain gardens, sediment control, park layout, vehicle and pedestrian routes, access to public transit, building siting and orientation, building materials and infrastructure. Design controls for all aspects of the development are also in place.

Features

Here are some of the prominent features of the Wesbrook Place neighbourhood:

- Largest complement of  faculty and staff housing
- Rental, family and seniors housing opportunities
- Convenient access to public transit
- Pedestrian-friendly green streets
- A community centre (in design development)
- A new 9-12 school (under construction)
- Six parks
- A commercial village anchored by Save-On Foods and complemented by a restaurant, coffee shop, liquor store and other convenient shops and services

Housing

Half of all households in Wesbrook Place will be work-study, meaning that at least one member of the household works or studies at UBC Vancouver.
